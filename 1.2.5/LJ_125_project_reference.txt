Overall funcitionality:
    - the The program is a simple implementation of the Snake game using Python's Turtle module.
    -The snake moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The user controls the snake's direction using the WASD keys.
    -When the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the screen borders or itself.
    -The high score is displayed along with the current score.

Code segment related to user input:
    - The WASD keys represnt the arrow keys, these keys help the snake move in the users desired direction.
    -This is the code that was used for the snake to move manipulated by the user:
        # Keyboard bindings
        wn.listen()
        wn.onkeypress(go_up, "w")
        wn.onkeypress(go_down, "s")
        wn.onkeypress(go_left, "a")
        wn.onkeypress(go_right, "d")
    -This code segment sets up the keyboard bindings to control the snake's movement.
    -When the user presses the "W" key, the snake moves up. Similarly, "S" for down, "A" for left, and "D" for right.
    -The user input represents the direction in which the snake should move.

Code segment related to a Function:
    -This was the code that used a Function:
        def move():
            if head.direction == "up":
                y = head.ycor()
                head.sety(y + 20)
    -This function (move) handles the movement of the snake based on its current direction.
    -It helps reduce duplication of code by focusing the logic for moving the snake in different directions.
    -Instead of repeating the movement logic every time the snake needs to move, we call this function, which improves the code's readability.
